  dialogues:
  - 'Hi there!

    (Press Space to continue...)'
  - We created this Dialogue Asset from Assets > Create > Dialogue Asset.
  - This is possible because we have created a script "DialogueAsset.cs", which uses
    a [CreateAssetMenu] attribute.
  - Scriptable Objects (like Dialogue Asset) are only meant to store data. So they
    can't be placed in the sene.
  - To display the text, we ceated a "Dialogue Player" component, that reads the
    content of our Dialogue Asset.
  - And here we are!
  - 'This box will close by itself the next time you press the input.

    Bye now!'
